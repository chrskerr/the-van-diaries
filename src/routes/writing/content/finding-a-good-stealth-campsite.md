It's starting to get darker or cold, perhaps its just dinner time and you know that you can't sleep wherever you are. Regardless, its exhausting constantly working out where you can get away with stealth camping in your van each and every night!

We have a personal interest in not pissing off the locals, and doing the right thing whenever we can, so we have a few guidelines that we follow to help achieve stress-free sleeping (even if we don't always succeed haha).

### Step 1 - Find water & a bathroom
We don't have a toilet in the van so we prefer to be near facilities. We feel that pissing in the street or a park is a great way to upset the locals, so will only do it in emergencies. 

Between us we use the (Australian) iPhone apps: Campermate & WikiCamps. These can be filtered on drinking water and bathrooms, helping to narrow down a list of locations rapidly.

**Bonus: finding a public shower too, though often this is a pit-stop during the day.**



### Step 2 - suss out the reviews and photos of the most promising
Nearby parks or playgrounds sometimes allow overnight parking in their carpark, but you can often sleep in street parking nearby. We try to move during the day if we do this to limit giving the impression of "moving into the neighbourhood", though for 2-3 nights this hasn't been a problem yet.

### Step 3 - look at major streets, thoroughfares or train lines nearby
These can get very noising, and sometimes don't stop even late at night.

### Step 4 - be prepared to drive to a few of the shortlist 
You'll get a very rapid feel for the area standing in it. How exposed is it, whats the community "feel" like, how are the facilities laid out, etc. We've moved on many times after finding someplace mediocre and then found something great.

Worst case scenario you can just go back!

### Step 5 - whats nearby?
Cafes, shopping centres, etc, is somewhere you'd happily spend some time or is this just about the sleep. Big consideration against that shortlist.

### Step 6 - leave it how you found it
Please don't contribute to the perception that vans can be bad guests! No garbage layout around, and if you're in a residential area keep noise to a respectful level. Parties in the park probably won't go down to well, but most people don't care about music, talking, and general enjoyment. The goal here is to make sure the next visitor isn't chased off ;)

We follow a similar process to this every few days to find a place to sleep near or at where we'd like to spend our day. Which leads into another upcoming post about finding awesome places to spend time while in your van, coming sometime soon!

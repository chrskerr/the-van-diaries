[Swinging Gate Vineyard](https://swinginggatewines.com.au) truly stood out for us because of their unusual approach to their product. Everything they made was slightly unusual and stood out from the normal cellar door market.

We're kinda stingy so often struggle to decide if we'll buy a bottle or two, and often buy none, but we had to limit ourselves to three and it was a very hard choice as to which!

The owners were super friendly and we had a 10/10 afternoon there. Would definitely return!

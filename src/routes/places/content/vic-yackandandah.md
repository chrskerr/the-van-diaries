Yackandandah has to be one of the cutest towns we've been to. Its filled with pubs, antique shops, cafes, pie shops, up a single main drag with the original facades mostly still in tact. 

#### How to:
- It's a smaller place so showers were harder (we asked nicely at the Yackandandah Hotel and they let us shower for $5 but this was definitely unusual for them and I understand that the caravan park has a similar deal).
- The Yak Tracks MTB park is nearby, which we intend to explore tomorrow.
- Gum Tree Pies has an amazing selection of pies and pastries.
- Blackwood distillery looks well worth visiting (hopefully it's open - we're here over Easter).
- We are currently planning on sleeping outside the public toilets on the corner of Railway Ave and Issacs Ave - will report in on how that goes too!
  - There are a few paid caravan sites nearby too

What a spot!!! Branxholm can best be described as Derby’s lesser known, quieter cousin. Only an 8 minute drive from the MTB trails, cafes and pubs at Derby, Branxholm is definitely the place to stop if you are after better facilities, a quieter rest area, cheap groceries (relevant to Tassie towns) and the only cafe you’ll need. Most likely you’ll stop in at this little town for one of four things:

1. **The rest area**
2. **Tin Timbers Cafe**
3. **The IGA**
4. **Close access to Blue Derby MTB trails** (without fighting the crowds by staying in Derby itself)


#### The rest area:
This is without question the BEST rest area we have discovered anywhere in Australia to date. It’s entirely free, you can stay up to 14 days at a time, and offers:
- A communal washing machine (bring your own washing powder, otherwise entirely free to use), 
- Tennis courts (free), 
- Pool (free, closed at nighttimes), 
- Playground, 
- Two toilet blocks, 
- Showers (hot water was a few dollars; we had cold showers instead for free), 
- BBQs (free), and 
- Really nice grass. 

I really want to emphasise here, if you are new to van life, never underestimate the value of quality grass at rest areas! Imagine being able to walk around barefoot and jump straight back in your campervan/car/camper without needing to clean your feet, you don’t have to worry about constant mud if it rains and you can actually sit on the ground…. yep, luxury.
This rest area also tends to be pretty quiet with plenty of room to pick your spot and have space to yourself. Especially when compared to Derby up the road where you’ll likely be shoulder to shoulder with other campers.

#### Tin Timbers Cafe:
About 50m from the rest area sits Tin Timbers Cafe - it’s an art gallery and cafe all in one. The staff are incredibly friendly and it seemed just about everything (maybe actually everything?) on the menu was made from scratch, in-house. Definitely don’t go past their homemade pies and toffee cake. If you’re a sucker for ice-cream (please be a sucker for ice-cream) and have not yet discovered Van Diemen’s Land Creamery you need to try their produce ASAP. Thankfully for you, it’s also stocked at Tin Timbers, so once you’ve demolished your pie and cake, why not have some ice cream too? Oh yeah, this place also has friendly alpaca out the back if you’re into that kind of thing.

#### IGA:
If you’re going to be staying in the Derby/Branxholm region for a little while, having the IGA right across the road from the rest area is an absolute godsend (note, in Derby the only general store has very very limited stock of essentials - do not expect to do your grocery shopping there). 
The IGA has just about everything you could need at very reasonable prices. Now you can stay that full 14 days no problems!

#### Access to Derby:
The world class MTB trails at Blue Derby (also completely free to use by the way!) are only an 8 minute drive away by car or you can take the very scenic bike/walk trail over to Derby. The trail goes through beautiful fern forrest and takes in views of the lake and is rated green (i.e. ‘easy’). To find the trail head up the hill from the rest area, take Albert St on your right, then Frederick St on your left, cross over the AFL field and you’ll see the starting point of the track clearly marked. The track is clear and well signed all the way to Derby from there at approx. 8km.
If you're interested to dig a bit deeper into the trails check out the [Blue Derby website](https://www.ridebluederby.com.au).

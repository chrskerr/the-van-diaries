St Helens is just the other side of Blue Tier from Derby, and is just south of the finish of the Bay of Fires Trail running from top of Blue Tier. 

It has great access to these trails, the Bay of Fires area, and to their own world-class MTB park. We stayed for far longer than originally planned in St Helens because we just couldn't get sick of the place!

#### How we did St Helens:
- We slept in both free camping (the Lions Park just south of town seemed to be pretty acceptable) and stealthy spots (in the carpark near the bathrooms by the marina). 
- The marina had a super faded no camping sign which we chose to ignore. We didn't get asked to leave over the 3 nights, but I think that that would've happened eventually. There is apparently a free caravan campsite nearby but we never went looking for it. 
- We showered at those bathrooms near the marina, which were about $4 and were hot.
- The mountain bike trails are awesome, we went up every day we were there. They are beautifully maintained and just a heap of fun to cruise through!
  - Our favourite loop was Rock Lobster into Wedged In. Good challenge for our beginnery selves and a reasonable distance to settle into.
  - We also climbed Garn Up and came back down Seeya Later which was a huge amount of fun but also a huge amount of climbing. Worth it if keen for a solid ride!
- The Tasmania Shop near the St Helens IGA stocks Van Diemens Land ice cream (which we loved) and has a huge selection of local beers/ciders/wines. We went there almost every day for at least an ice cream.
- The United petrol station does $1 coffees if you're into that.

St Helen's is on our list of places to definitely return to, and potentially even to live in!

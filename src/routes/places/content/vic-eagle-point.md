Eagle Point was an easy place to spend a few hours by the bay and then sleep overnight. It has free bathrooms with clean water, what looked like okay access to the caravan park's bbqs (if you were prepared to discreetly walk in and use them), and the bay to swim in in nice weather.

We parked & slept near the public bathrooms, maybe 50m toward School Road, just outside the caravan parks fence, and had no trouble at all. 

We had a few friendly interactions with the locals, and then drove off the following morning to Bairnsdale for their ParkRun, breakfast and supplies. They had all the essentials there plus a number of solid cafes, so it was worth dropping in if need an easy place to sleep a night or two.

As the summary states, we did not have a relaxing time here. It ends up being not cheap to stay once showers and water are both paid for, and they aren't particulary nice facilities. 

I'd much rather have stayed at an actual caravan park for only a little more money.

Wouldn't bother unless you have other business in the area.

Freycinet National Park is full of beautiful scenery and interesting walks. We definitely recommend you make the stop in here!

The main walks and lookouts are highly worth doing, especially the Wineglass Bay lookout. We wanted something bigger and accidentally bit off a huge day out in the park! 

In retrospect, attempting a 3 day hike as a single day trail run was extremely ambitious, but to be fair, the gradient and length didn't seem that crazy for a single day...

We ran out over Wineglass Bay, then down to the peninsular, crossed over to Hazards Beach, then ran south to Cooks Beach, then up and over Mount Graham and finally followed the trail straight north back to the carpark. This was beautiful from the start, crystal clear water, deserted beaches, amazing views, but when we hit Mount Graham the trail look on a much scramblier aspect and we slowed down hugely. It took us longer to cross Mount Graham than thee entire remainder of the walk I would estimated.

Despite being far far longer and far harder than anticipated, the run was worth it the end!

Otherwise:
- We slept at the Paintball campground. It was nicely grassed and the owners are very friendly. There are some free options nearby but they were very dusty and dirty, so this was easily worth the few dollars.
- Prepare yourself to see many snakes too!

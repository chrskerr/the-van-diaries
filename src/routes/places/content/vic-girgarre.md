I cannot put clearly enough into words just how incredibly shit Girgarre was... for some reason the local council has decided to provide a decent enough free camp facility for travelers, however Chris and I could not figure out why they would bother to save our lives.

There is quite literally nothing in this town. Why build a free camping facility if there is nothing for travelers to do here or anywhere to spend their money? There's not one shop anywhere (seriously, not a single one). There's one very small park with a random piano near the free camp area, a bunch of houses, and....that's it. 

Also, I'm not sure if we just got Girgarre on a bad day, but the town smelt like shit. Everywhere. Literaly animal shit. We ended up keeping the van basically entirely closed to try to minimise the constant stench.

Surprisingly however, the free camp area had decent enough toilets and free showers with hot water.

So if you're really desperate for a shower and are in the area, it does the job for that.

If you do happen to check out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.girgarre.com.au">Girgarre town website</a>, do not be fooled - they make it sound relitively interesting, it is NOT.

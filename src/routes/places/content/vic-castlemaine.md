Castlemaine was a true highlight of country Victoria. It had everything that Kate and I wanted: beautiful outdoor spaces, easy stealth camping near bathrooms & water, excellent baked goods, local ice cream, nearby mountain bike parks, and cheap access to a shower at the local pool/gym!

We went in expecting to spend the day exploring a cafe or two at my parents recommendation and ended up staying for days, until we felt we were potentially wearing out our welcome.

#### The area:
- We camped by the Botanical Gardens, near the bathrooms. There was a little street noise from the road and trains, but this stopped overnight. The area was constantly lit by street lights so felt safe but we definitely appreciated the good curtains!
- The Old Mill: a collection of local shops about 900m from our "camp" site comprising of a Viennese cafe, local ice cream, a vineyard cellar door, a brewery, a chocolate shop, a baker, clothes, antiques, pilates & gym studios, and more. We walked here almost every day for coffee, ice cream, chocolates, etc.
- Harcourt Trails: great mountain biking a short drive away, apparently near a cider brewery (which we sadly never visited...).
- Cafes: too many to count, you can't go wrong with most of them.
- Showers are at the gym/pool in town, was $2 each for a very clean and well maintained bathroom.
- There are two IGAs and plenty of smaller shops for supplies.
- We also did the local Park Run on the Saturday morning that started right at the Botanical Gardens where we were sleeping (very convient of them!)


If you're nearby or looking for a beautiful place to stop and slow down for a little while, this city could be just the spot!

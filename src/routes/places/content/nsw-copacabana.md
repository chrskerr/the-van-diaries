Similar to Killcare, Copacabana is a very quiet small town focussed on the beach and the water.

The natural beauty here makes this a wonderful place to spend a few days soaking in the sun and unwinding, especially if you have just left Sydney! We loved every minute of the slow pace and easy access to everything we might need.

We showered at the beach showers, used the surf club's bathrooms and water fountain, and ate far too many pastries from Burnt Honey!

Lady Copa is an awesome dinner experience with great wines and food, if you're in the mood to eat out while here. I'd definitely recommend dropping in!

An idyllic mountain town, seemingly focussed on snow sports, cycle sports, climbing the mountains, and just being outside.

We originally came on the recommendation that the Big Hill mtb park had awesome undercover facilities that we could work from over a few wet days (the facilities were great! Well covered, easy electricity, bbqs, cold showers, clean water, etc) but little did we know how long we'd stay!

Day two we attempted to run to the top of Mount Bogong just nearby. It was one of the toughest climbs we've done in terms of sustained steepness but paid of with beautiful views from (near) the top. Since we were running it and travelling light, we were unprepared for a strong change of wind near the summit which caused us to retreat into the trees for warmth.

What we've loved:
- Amazing mtb trail. The only criticism you could have is that there is too much trail and sometimes it's hard to keep track of all the intersections. There are a few spots which are light on signage, but mostly its very clear and super well maintained. We've already been up a few times and aren't planning on leave yet! Very flowy and fun. We've barely scratched the surface of this park.
- Free (cold) showers at the mtb trail head.
- So much other trail nearby. Mt Bogong as above, Mt Feathertop isn't far off. Being an alpine region, almost everywhere on the map is forest & trail.
- There are a few honest free campsites nearby (Mountain Creek Campground, for example), but we slept at the pinned location on the map. In the carpark of the oval near the toilets and skate park. It was quiet and seemed to bother no-one. Its far enough from the road that you're not in anyones immediate space.

We'll genuinely come back again some day soon, this has been a real highlight of the trip.

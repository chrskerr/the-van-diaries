Beechworth was objectively a wonderful town, plenty of character and lots to see, but we found it very hard from the van, so we moved on quite quickly (we also had someone try to steal the bikes off of the van at 2am which didn't help our opinion!).

#### Our take:
- The lake was small but pretty, and was a nice place for a swim to get ourselves a little more clean.
- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.eldoradoroad.com.au/">Eldorado Road</a> was a lovely experience and sold an awesome ros√©. Friendly and welcoming, and a great spot for a wine or two.
- Sleeping by the Visitor Information Centre felt like a great idea as it was next to the only public bathrooms, but in retrospect it was very very visible so might've been why someone attempted to take the bikes hahah.

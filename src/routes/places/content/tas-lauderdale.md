We discovered this absolute gem off the recommendation of fellow van-life travellers, and ended up staying for here for nearly a week.

We parked the van at the beach carpark, had solar panels and washing out, were anything but subtle, and had many locals come over and chat to us about the fact that we should stay as long as we can! So as far as stealth camp spots go, this one was very relaxed.

##### To find the spot, search for the public toilet at Lauderdale beach (92 North Terrace, Lauderdale) on Google maps right next to the carpark.


Enough rambling, you probably want some details! Why this stealth spot was awesome:
- The beach carpark is literally at the beach. I’m talking a 20 metre walk from the van to the sand. This also becomes your daily shower so if you’re visiting in Winter months I hope you’re OK with cold water! 
- The public toilets are open 24/7
- The carpark was flat ground so you can park there and sleep without any rolling off the bed issues
- The other side of the carpark was a small picnic area with free BBQs and tables, next to the Ralphs Bay Canal (essentially a body of water surrounded by a nature path)
- About 800m walk away at the far side of the Canal is a Hill Street IGA. If you aren’t familiar with this chain of IGAs yet, they’re basically really fancy supermarkets. Nice deli, good wines, local produce, that sort of thing. I.e. yum.
- The locals encouraged us to stay and seemed to be very used to the occasional van lifer doing the exact same thing
- Great accessibility into Hobart, only about a 15 min drive to the centre of town (FYI unlike most cities we are used to you’ll find you can actually drive into Hobart without too many traffic problems and find a park fairly easily)
- Great phone signal so you can do all the online activities you please

As always when stealth camping, be nice to the locals, pick up your rubbish and otherwise enjoy the *free*dom (hehe….get it ;) )

##### Things to do in Hobart:
- [MONA museum](https://mona.net.au), definitely worth the entry fee ($30 for non-Tasmanian adults at time of writing). Coming from someone who ordinarily finds both museums and art to be exceptionally boring, this museum has been executed amazingly well.  
- North-South MTB track - see more at blog post here
- [Cascade brewery](https://www.cascadebreweryco.com.au); fun fact, the oldest brewery in Australia 
- [Salamanca markets](https://www.salamancamarket.com.au) every Saturday morning and the alleys around the markets
- Clarence MTB track - a great mountain bike park. We spent most of our time here playing around at the skill park - really awesome way for us to learn how to take tight corners and jumps
- North South MTB track - one of the great original MTB tracks in Tasmania, this 11km loop is worth a ride. For more info check out [here](https://www.hobartcity.com.au/Community/Events-and-activities/Tracks-and-trails/Mountain-biking-and-activities/Mountain-bike-tracks/North-South-Track) 
- [Van Diemans Land Creamery](https://vdlcreamery.com.au) - now we eat a lot of ice cream (also why we do a lot of MTB riding!) and both agreed VDLC needed to be part of our daily diet while in Hobart

Wangaratta was a great place to hole up for a few days thanks to the free showers at Apex Park and the start of the rail trail, that runs the entire way from Wangaratta to Bright (a total of 84kms each way if you are up for a big day of riding!).

The town of Wangaratta itself we didn't think was anything particularly amazing, but if you are looking for somewhere very relaxing to base yourself for a few days of cycling or just to chill out amongst the tress, it was perfect. Great foodie experience just out of town at the Milawa produce hub too.

### Apex Park facilities
- Conveniently located just at the edge of town, and a very easy walk to shops, supermarkets, cafes etc. The park is also literally the start of the [Murray to Mountains Rail Trail](https://www.ridehighcountry.com.au/rail-trails/murray-to-mountains/the-long-ride-to-bright/) 
- 2 free showers found in the unmarked doors in the toilet block (they even have hot water!)
- BBQs and tap water
- Flat parking that is easy for sleeping and with no time restrictions or any signs indicating they don't want you sleeping there overnight

###Foodie things nearby
- The best foodie experience we found in and amongst Wangaratta was by far the Milawa complex
- An amalgamnation of a few local produce stores all at the one facility, there was [Milawa Bread](https://milawaandco.com.au/milawa-bread/) (we tried their lemon curd cruffin which was awesome), 
- [Milawa Cheese](https://www.milawacheese.com.au) - which to be honest we thought was quite average
- Vineyard (awesome wines, we took home 3 bottles)
- And a great gift shop
The whole complex had the most beautiful farmland outlook, and an incredible wall of vines that almost blocked off the complex from the parking/road

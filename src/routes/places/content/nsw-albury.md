To be fair to Albury, we only used it as a working stopover on the way North toward Canberra, so we barely explored the possibilities here.

#### What we did find:
- Free cold showers at the Noreuil Park Foreshore public toilets - similarly this park was beautiful, had bbqs, and many swim spots in the river. Great place to spend a day. No camping signs up everywhere, so we didn't sleep here, but we did see a few  car-campers taking the chance on it who were still there in the morning, seemingly undisturbed.
- Huge undercover area with tables, 240v power points, bbqs, water and nearby toilets at the Albury Community Wood Fired Over (pinned on the map). Was an awesome spot to get some work done without worrying about the sun or solar. We parked and slept in the street parking adjacent.
- A big library nearby in case the above doesn't suit.

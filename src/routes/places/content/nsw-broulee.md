If you're traveling along the East Coast of NSW, Broulee Beach was an incredibly easy and nice place to stealth camp for a night (or more).

We stayed at the carpark at Broulee Beach on two separate occasions - in Jan 2021, and a month earlier in Dec 2020 when we were on a test run of our van build!

### Things to know:
- The surf club at the Broulee Beach carpark has a few outdoor showers
- The toilets stay open 24/7
- You will be right next to a beautiful, long beach
- The suburb of Broulee is very basic, one exceptionally limited general store and a small cafe - so I'd recommend buying anything you need before getting there
- Mossy Point cafe just up the road is a local fave!

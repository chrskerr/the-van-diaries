There isn't much to Killcare, and I think that that's most of it's charm. We slept on the side of the road overlooking the Hawkesbury River and spent the morning sitting in the autumn sun working and eating at the picnic tables here.

It had toilets and water, and the Fat Goose cafe was delicious, and was generally an extremely pleasant place to spend a little time.

Boudee National Park is right next door too, which is a major plus if you like outdoor adventures!

# Markdown Guide

Markdown is the language used to write blog posts (all the text on the page). You can see more information here: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

How To: 

- Copy this file into the parent folder (content), give it a unique name, with dashes ("-") between the words and ending in .md, eg "derby-mountain-biking.md"
- Update all the details above, and text here (everything from "# Markdown Guide" and below, should be deleted and replaced with the blog content, talk to me if you want to add extra pictures over the above one)
- Go to the menu and press View then Terminal (halfway down), then type "yarn && yarn dev", then go to a browser and go to address "localhost:3000" to view your new blog post and make sure its okay
